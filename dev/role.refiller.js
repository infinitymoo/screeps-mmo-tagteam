/* Summarized Behaviour
**
** Refillers depend on a room Storage and Prioritization of refilling targets is Base Link and then filling things on the way, otherwise drop in Storage as fall-back
**
** 1 - If creep cargo is empty, switch to pickup mode through 'transport' state attribute = false
** 2 - If creep cargo full, switch to dropoff mode through 'transport' = true

** 3 - if in dropoff mode, check if have targetlock with a store attribute for pickup and if so, fill structures on our way moving there
** 4 - if targetLock target has no free capacity, switch to fillable structures as target to go for as fallback
** 5 - as discussed in #3, fill thigns on way to targetLocked target
** 6 - if we didn't get an early function return because of #5 happening, it means we haven't transferred energy yet, so might be at target to do it now, and if successful, release targetLock

** 7 - if we didn't have a targetLock for the above block of code to run with, check homeRoom attribute, find a link, and go fill it up
** 8 - if no targets to go fill up that has space (see #4), then lets go fill up from room's Storage, which is same as pickup behaviour

** 9 - Pickup mode, get from room Storage As #1 shows, pickup mode is on when no energy to transfer or #8 happens

/** Limitations to address asap
 * 1 homeRoom attribute management
 * 2 Dependence on Storage structure - why not behave like transport if no Storage?
 * 3 modularize behaviours as much is shared with transport role
